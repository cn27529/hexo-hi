jQuery.LocalScroll description

jQuery.LocalScroll is a jQuery plugin that will animate a regular anchor navigation.

It will allow your visitors to navigate your site with a smooth scrolling effect.

Each time a link is clicked, the element you decide(can be the whole screen), will gradually scroll to the targeted element, instead of "jumping" as it'd normally do. jQuery.ScrollTo is used for the animation.

The plugin supports dynamically added/loaded anchors and local links.
